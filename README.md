# Tech Lay Offs

Tech firms around the globe are suffering lay offs. Slow consumer spending, higher interest rates, and strong dollars overseas are the responsable factors for what is currently happening in the tech industry.

The purpose of this analysis is to undertand he recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights. To perform this analysis I will ise the lay offs datasets from 11 March 2020 (when Covid was declared as a pandemic) to present 20 April 2024.  

The first part of this analysis will be the cleaning of the data. We will follow the following steps:
1. Check for duplicates
2. Fix estructural errors
3. Examine NULL values
4. Remove unnecessary rows and columns

The second part will be the exploratory data analysis where I will try to understand important aspecs and trends from the layoff data.
